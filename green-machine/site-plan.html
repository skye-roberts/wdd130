      Our Story
      <br><br>The Roberts family founded Green Machine in 2023, after being faced with a rarity of healthy food options in their town.  The company’s main purpose is to change lives and communities from the inside out – by feeding soul as well as the body. We strive to connect people to others in their community through group cooking classes and shared seating options, and to connect people to themselves by helping them feel better and more energized through healthy, local food.
      <br><br>Our Philosophy
      <br><br>Sweeten with Fruit
      <br>No refined sugars
      <br>We’ve found that fruits are the perfect alternative to refined sugars. We will always sweeten with fruit first, and occasionally we’ll supplement with natural sweeteners like monk fruit and stevia.
      <br><br>Focus on the Nutrients
      <br>No more calorie counting
      <br>We strive to shift the focus in familiar diets from calorie-counting to nutrient consciousness. Calories are just one attribute of food. Nutrients involve so much more.
      <br><br>Made from Scratch
      <br>Every day with love
      <br>Everything we serve is made from scratch, with love, everyday. This way, we don’t need to rely on canned food or added preservatives. You know exactly what you’re getting.
